I expected Actions-N-Stuff to be public; now that it's a marketplace addon, this upkeep is no longer feasible. 


# Actions-N-Stuff
AvgZing's modified version of the Actions N Stuff 1.0.2 Beta for the Oakridge: Survival Unhinged Server. This eliminates unnecesary pack conflicts with Oakridge modifications. 

This is a cut down version of the pack with the following notable changes:
- Removed Armor Stand model
- Oakridge icon on loading screen
- Removed player animations due to [MCPE-74493](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-74493)
- Removed shield animations
- Removed totem attachable
- Removed fire pattern
- Removed custom illager banner pattern and shield pattern
- Removed custom villager profession skins
- Removed custom enchantment glint
- Removed custom spyglass scope
- Removed custom potion effect particles (Allows for No potion particles)
- Fixed bug where a number of attachables displayed too large in hand
- Removed mule animations to allow armor (may be reverted in future)
- Removed camels and sniffers; vanilla is better
- Removed wandering trader minor retexture
- Fixed skeleton bow draw sound being played as an ambient sound
- Removed block attachables (where the block displayed as a custom model in hand)
- Removed food attachables (where foods displayed as 3d in hand)
